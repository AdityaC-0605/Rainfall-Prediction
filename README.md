# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction Model

This project uses machine learning to predict **rainfall amounts** based on meteorological data. The goal is to assist in weather forecasting and agricultural planning by providing accurate rainfall predictions.

---

## 📌 Features

- Predicts **rainfall levels** using weather-related input features such as:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Wind speed
  - Pressure
  - Cloud cover
  - Previous rainfall

- Includes:
  - Data preprocessing pipeline
  - Model training and evaluation
  - Support for regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
  - (Optional) API for real-time predictions

## 🧠 Model Overview

You can experiment with various regression models like:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor

Models are trained and compared using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R² Score.
